# FlexboxRb

FlexBoxRb is a wrapper for the awesome gryd system from [@kristoferjoseph](https://github.com/kristoferjoseph), original project can be found here: https://github.com/kristoferjoseph/flexboxgrid.

This gem allows you to easily include FlexboxGrid into your projects, it also provides your views with some helper methods to create grid dynamic gryd systems.

Plus, with our custom methods you don't have to write `<div class="box"></div>` for each one of your elements in the grid, because the helper methods already do so ;)


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'flexbox_rb'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install flexbox_rb

## Usage

Add the css file to your application.css file
```css
*= require flexboxgrid
```

It also allows you to use custom methods for the grid in your views. For example:

```ruby
grid_md_12 do
 <h1> Hola mundo </h1>
end
```

Outputs:
```html
<div class="col-md-12"><div class="box">
 <h1> Hola mundo </h1>
</div></div>
```

You can also specify the columns number for each device size (xs,sm,md,lg) in the options hash when using the `grid` method

```ruby
grid md:6,xs:12 do
 <h1> Hola mundo </h1>
end
```

Outputs:
```html
<div class="col-md-6 col-xs-12"><div class="box">
 <h1> Hola mundo </h1>
</div></div>
```

Every method accepts a hash of options that it's translated in to html attributes, so

```ruby
grid_md_6 id:"div_id", class:"card", style:"padding:10px" do
 <h1> Hola mundo </h1>
end
```

Outputs
```html
<div class="col-md-6 card" id="div_id" style="padding:10px"><div class="box">
 <h1> Hola mundo </h1>
</div></div>
```



##Available methods
grid_lg_n

grid_md_n

grid_sm_n

grid_xs_n


Where n is a number >=1 and <=12
